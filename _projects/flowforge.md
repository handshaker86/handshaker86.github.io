**FlowForge** is a high-performance compiler designed to optimize machine learning models for fluid dynamics simulations. 

It involves:
* **Compiler Design:** Leveraging LLVM/MLIR infrastructure.
* **Optimization:** Creating specific passes for flow field prediction.
* **Evaluation:** Benchmarking against standard PyTorch implementations.
