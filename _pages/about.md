I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I work firmly with [Prof. David L.S. Hung](https://gc.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/93/) and [Dr. Fengnian Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pn4lxsIAAAAJ&hl) at [FDA Lab](https://gc.sjtu.edu.cn/research/laboratories/laboratory-detail/53/). I am currently visiting Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as an exchange student.

My research interests center on **Machine Learning Systems**, with a particular focus on LLM Inference Efficiency. I am passionate about bridging the gap between algorithms and underlying hardware to build efficient, scalable systems.

Recently, I developed **FlowForge**, a compile–execute system designed to tackle the computational challenges in physical flow field prediction. By addressing system-level bottlenecks, FlowForge enables efficient and stable training and inference for complex fluid dynamics, significantly outperforming standard deep learning frameworks. (Paper under review)
