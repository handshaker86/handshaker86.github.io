I am an undergraduate student majoring in Electronical an Computer Engineering(ECE) at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, currently visiting **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** as an exchange student.

My research interests lie in **Computer Systems**, **Machine Learning Compilers**, and **High-Performance Computing**. I am particularly interested in the intersection of deep learning and system optimization.

Currently, I am working on **FlowForge (TFF)**, a project focused on machine learning compiler design for fluid dynamics.
